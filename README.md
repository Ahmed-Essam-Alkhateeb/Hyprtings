# Hyprtings

A GUI settings application for [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org/)

## Installation

Still in development, so no binaries or anyway to install it, only to [build](./README.md#Build) it.

## Build

To build the project, you must have [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [node](https://nodejs.org/en) alongside a package manager for node.

After that, clone the repo wherever you would want it and just execute `npm run tauri dev`. 

Be warned that rust takes a long time to compile, so just go ahead and do something else while it is doing its job, you will probably run out of things to do before it is done. This is a one time thing so next compilations will not take as much time (probably like 15 seconds to 30 seconds). It might not even take much if the changes are done only on the JS part of things, just that if there are changes to rust, it will recompile (sped up of course)

## Contribution

To contribute, you could open an issue or have a stab at a pull request, any contribution is welcome.
